Welcome!

Here I provide Python scripts to calculate the grain collisional velocities in
different turbulence models, based on the paper Gong et al. (2021), https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09525

In "grain_collision_gong2021.py", I provide the classes and functions for
setting up turbulence models and calculating grain collisional velocities based
on numerical integration or analytic approximation. The analytic approximation
is simple, fast, and accurate, and can be easily implemented in other codes for
calculating grain size evolution.

In the "vcoll.ipynb" Ipython Notebook, I provide examples for using the classes and functions in
"grain_collision_gong2021.py", by reproducing Figure 2 in Gong et al. (2021).
I also saved this Ipython Notebook to the html format as "vcoll.html", so you
can view the content even if you do not use Ipython.

Enjoy! Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
