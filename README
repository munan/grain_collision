Welcome!

Here I provide Python scripts to calculate the grain collisional velocities in
different turbulence models, based on the paper Gong et al. (2021).

%TODO: paper ref.

In "grain_collision_gong2021.py", I provide the classes and functions for
setting up turbulence models and calculating grain collisional velocities based
on numerical integration or analytic approximation. The analytic approximation
is simple, fast, and accurate, and can be easily implemented in other codes for
calculating grain size evolution.

In "vcoll.ipynb", I provide examples for using the classes and functions in
"grain_collision_gong2021.py", by reproducing Figure 2 in Gong et al. (2021).

Enjoy! Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
